    <h1>Cloud Creators – Terms & Conditions</h1>
        
        <h2>Advance Payment Policy</h2>
        <p>All advance payments made to Cloud Creators are non-refundable under any circumstances, including project cancellation by the client.</p>

        <h2>Prototypes & Approval</h2>
        <p>Prototype images/mockups are provided for illustration purposes only. The final delivered product may vary in design, color, layout, or features due to technical feasibility, platform constraints, or optimization needs.</p>
        <p>Once the prototype is approved by the client, any new changes, revisions, or additions outside the approved prototype scope will be charged separately as per the prevailing rates.</p>

        <h2>Quotation Validity & Scope</h2>
        <p>Quotations provided are valid for 15 days from the date of issue.</p>
        <p>The quotation covers only the items and features mentioned. Any additional requirements will incur extra charges.</p>

        <h2>Payment Terms</h2>
        <p>Payments are collected in stages: Advance Payment → Milestone Payments → Final Payment before deployment.</p>
        <p>Deployment or handover will be done only after receiving the full and final payment.</p>
        <p>Late payments may result in project delays or suspension until dues are cleared.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Charges</h2>
        <p>Domain name registration, renewal charges, server hosting fees, database storage costs, SSL certificates, and any other third-party services are charged separately from the development fee.</p>
        <p>The client is responsible for annual renewals of domain, hosting, and other services unless a separate maintenance contract is signed.</p>
        <p>Failure to renew may result in website/app downtime, for which Cloud Creators is not responsible.</p>

        <h2>Change Requests & Extra Work</h2>
        <p>Changes requested after project commencement that were not included in the original scope will be charged extra and may affect delivery timelines.</p>
        <p>Any delays caused by the client (e.g., late feedback, late content submission) will extend the delivery date accordingly.</p>

        <h2>Deployment & Maintenance</h2>
        <p>Deployment will be done only on cleared payments.</p>
        <p>After deployment, any bug fixes related to the initial scope will be done free of cost for 7 days only.</p>
        <p>No new features will be implemented during this free 7-day bug fix period.</p>
        <p>After this period, all new features, changes, or bug fixes will be charged as per the current rates.</p>
        <p>Periodic paid maintenance can be availed by the client, but the cost is not fixed and may vary from time to time.</p>
        <p>Cloud Creators is not liable for downtime caused by third-party hosting/server issues.</p>

        <h2>Ownership & Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>Full rights to the developed website/app/software will be transferred to the client only after full payment is received.</p>
        <p>Until final payment, all designs, code, and materials remain the property of Cloud Creators.</p>
        <p>Cloud Creators reserves the right to showcase the completed project in its portfolio unless explicitly restricted in writing.</p>

        <h2>Client Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>The client must provide accurate and complete project requirements, content, images, and any legal permissions for materials used.</p>
        <p>Cloud Creators will not be liable for any legal issues arising from copyrighted, trademarked, or prohibited content provided by the client.</p>

        <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p>If the client cancels the project at any stage, all payments made till that point are non-refundable and no further work will be delivered.</p>
        <p>Any pending payments for work already completed must be cleared immediately upon cancellation.</p>

        <h2>Data Security & Backup</h2>
        <p>Cloud Creators is not responsible for loss of data after deployment unless a paid maintenance contract is active.</p>
        <p>Clients are responsible for maintaining their own backups of websites, apps, and databases unless otherwise agreed.</p>

        <h2>Limitations of Liability</h2>
        <p>Cloud Creators is not responsible for losses due to delays caused by third parties, technical issues outside our control, or force majeure events (natural disasters, internet outages, etc.).</p>
        <p>Cloud Creators does not guarantee specific business results or revenue from the delivered project.</p>

        <h2>Legal Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>All disputes shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in [Your City/State, India].</p>
